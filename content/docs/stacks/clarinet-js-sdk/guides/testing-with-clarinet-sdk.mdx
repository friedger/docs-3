Deployment plans minimize the inherent complexity of deployments, such as smart contract dependencies and interactions, transaction chaining limits, deployment costs, and more, while ensuring reproducible deployments critical for testing purposes.

In this guide, you will learn how to:

1. Generate and configure a deployment plan.
2. Set deployment plan specifications.
3. Add project contract requirements.
4. Customize your deployment plan.

The SDK requires Node.js >= 18.0 and NPM to be installed. [Volta](https://volta.sh/) is a great tool to install and manage JS tooling.

## Comprehensive Unit Tests for `counter`

Let us now write a higher coverage test suite by testing the `decrement` and `get-counter` functions.

These two code blocks can be added at the end of `tests/counter.test.ts`.

```ts
describe('test `decrement` public function', () => {
  it('decrements the count by the given value', () => {
    const decrementResponse = simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'decrement', [Cl.uint(1)], address1);
    expect(decrementResponse.result).toBeOk(Cl.uint(0));

    const count1 = simnet.getDataVar('counter', 'count');
    expect(count1).toBeUint(0);

    // increase the count so that it can be descreased without going < 0
    simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'increment', [Cl.uint(10)], address1);

    simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'decrement', [Cl.uint(5)], address1);
    const count2 = simnet.getDataVar('counter', 'count');
    expect(count2).toBeUint(5);
  });

  it('sends a print event', () => {
    const decrementResponse = simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'decrement', [Cl.uint(1)], address1);

    expect(decrementResponse.events).toHaveLength(1);
    const printEvent = decrementResponse.events[0];
    expect(printEvent.event).toBe('print_event');
    expect(printEvent.data.value).toBeTuple({
      object: Cl.stringAscii('count'),
      action: Cl.stringAscii('decremented'),
      value: Cl.uint(0),
    });
  });
});
```

```ts
describe('test `get-count` read only function', () => {
  it('returns the counter value', () => {
    const count1 = simnet.callReadOnlyFn('counter', 'read-count', [], address1);
    expect(count1.result).toBeOk(Cl.uint(1));

    simnet.callPublicFn('counter', 'increment', [Cl.uint(10)], address1);
    const count2 = simnet.callReadOnlyFn('counter', 'read-count', [], address1);
    expect(count2.result).toBeOk(Cl.uint(11));
  });
});
```

## Measure and Increase Code Coverage

To help developers maximize their test coverage, the test framework can produce a `lcov` report, using `--coverage` flag. You can set it in the scripts in the project `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test:coverage": "vitest run -- --coverage",
    // ...
  },
```

Then run the script with the following command. It will produce a file named `./lcov.info`.

```sh
npm run test:coverage
```

From there, you can use the `lcov` tooling suite to produce HTML reports.

```sh
brew install lcov
genhtml --branch-coverage -o coverage lcov.info
open coverage/index.html
```

## Costs Optimization

The test framework can also be used to optimize costs. When you execute a test suite, Clarinet keeps track of all costs being computed when executing the `contract-call`, and displays the most expensive ones in a table.

To help developers maximize their test coverage, the test framework can produce a `lcov` report, using `--coverage` flag. You can set it in the scripts in the project `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test:costs": "vitest run -- --costs",
    // ...
  },
```

And run the script with the following command. It will produce a file named `./costs-reports.json`.

```sh
npm run test:costs
```

For now, there isn't much you can do out of the box with a costs report. But in future versions of the Clarinet JS SDK, we will implement features to help keep track of your costs, such as checking that function calls do not go above a certain threshold.

## Produce Both Coverage and Costs Reports

In your package.json, you should already have a script called `test:report` like so:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test:report": "vitest run -- --coverage --costs",
    // ...
  },
```

Run it to produce both the coverage and the costs reports:

```sh
npm run test:report
```

## Run Tests in CI

Because the tests only require Node.js and NPM run, they can also be run in GitHub actions and CIs just like any other Node test.

In GitHub, you can directly set up a Node.js workflow like this one:

```yml
name: Test counter contract

on:
  push:
    branches: ['main']
  pull_request:
    branches: ['main']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test:reports
```
