The Signer Metrics API enables you to monitor the behavior of signers on the Stacks network and analyze and evaluate their performance. This API uses a familiar REST interface and lets you easily fetch information about the signer network, such as lists of active signers in a particular PoX cycle and signer information for a particular block, as well as behavioral data for individual signers, such as their block acceptance rate or their average block push time.
