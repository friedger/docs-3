## Get block by hash

**NOTE:** This endpoint is deprecated in favor of [Get block](/api/get-block).

Retrieves block details of a specific block for a given chain height. You can use the hash from your latest block ('get_block_list' API) to get your block details.

| Status code | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `200` | Block |
| `404` | Cannot find block with given ID |
