## Get recent blocks

**NOTE:** This endpoint is deprecated in favor of [Get blocks](/api/get-blocks).

Retrieves a list of recently mined blocks

If you need to actively monitor new blocks, we highly recommend subscribing to [WebSockets or Socket.io](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-blockchain-api/tree/master/client) for real-time updates.

### Query Parameters

<Property name={"limit"} type={"integer"} required={false} deprecated={false}>

max number of blocks to fetch

<span>Default: `20`</span>

<span>Maximum: `30`</span>

</Property>

<Property name={"offset"} type={"integer"} required={false} deprecated={false}>

index of first block to fetch

<span>Example: `42000`</span>

</Property>

| Status code | Description |
| :------ | :------ |
| `200` | List of blocks |
