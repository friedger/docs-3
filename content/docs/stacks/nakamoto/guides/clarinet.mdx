## Launch devnet in Nakamoto mode

As of [Clarinet 2.4.0](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet/releases/tag/v2.4.0), devnet can run the blockchain in Nakamoto mode.

Once your devnet reaches the right block height, it will deploy the `pox-4.clar` contract and run in
Epoch 2.5.
From there, Clarinet will send `stack-stx` and `stack-extend` requests to the new PoX contract.
In Nakamoto mode, devnet has 2 signers. Eventually, you can observe the
`vote-for-aggregate-public-key` transactions that they send.

Do not expect to reach Epoch 3.0 with Clarinet 2.4.0. This release is focusing on Epoch 2.5.
Epoch 3.0, with fast blocks and others improvements, will come in a future release.

### Setting up a project for Nakamoto

Using one of your Clarinet projects, or a new one (with `clarinet new nakamoto-project`), update the
`settings/Devnet.toml`.

Under the `[devnet]` section when `use_nakamoto = true` is set, the `pox-4.clar` contract should be
deployed around the **Bitcoin block 108**.

```toml
[devnet]
use_nakamoto = true
```

Start devnet with `clarinet devnet start`.

## Deploy contracts on the Nakamoto Testnet

A Nakamoto testnet is available and running in Epoch 2.5. Clarinet can be used to deploy contracts
on testnet.

In a Clarinet project, the `settings/Testnet.toml` file can be updated like so:

```toml
[network]
name = "testnet"
stacks_node_rpc_address = "https://api.testnet.hiro.so"
deployment_fee_rate = 10

[accounts.deployer]
mnemonic = "<YOUR PRIVATE TESTNET MNEMONIC HERE>"
```

Then run the following command to generate the deployments plan and deploy the contracts:

```sh
clarinet deployments generate --testnet --medium-cost
clarinet deployments apply --testnet
```
