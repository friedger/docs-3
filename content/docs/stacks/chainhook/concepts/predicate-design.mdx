title: Predicate Design
description: Predicates are the building blocks of Chainhook.
toc: true
---

The core design of Chainhook revolves around the concept of predicates. Each individual Chainhook has a customizable predicate that specifies what the Bitcoin or Stacks blockchain data you are scanning for.

<Callout type="warn" title="Requirements">
  Commands outlined here will require that you have installed Chainhook [directly](/stacks/chainhook/installation).
</Callout>

## Predicate design
Below is the general strucure of the `predicate` JSON with its primary elements.  These elements and their values are required. 

- Chainhook will evaluate the predicate against the specfied blockchain specified in `chain`.
- The `uuid` will be returned in the Chainhook payload, providing a record of the predicate that triggers it.
- Identify your predicate for your DApp using `name` and `version`.

```json
  {
    "chain": "stacks",
    "uuid": "1",
    "name": "STX_Transfer_Predicate",
    "version": 1,
    "networks": {
      // Other configurations
    }
  }
  ```

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  You can use the following command to verify your predicate:
  ```
    chainhook predicate check your-predicate-file.json --mainnet
  ```
</Callout>

## Networks

The `networks` element contains an object who's key determines the blockchain network you want Chainhook to scan.  
- This object's value will contain the `if_this` and then `then_that` specifications.
- Multple networks can be specified in the `networks` element.

```json
  "networks": {
    "mainnet": {
      // if_this and then_that specifications
      // Other configurations
    },
    "testnet": {
      // if_this and then_that specifications
      // Other configurations
    },
  }
```

## if_this specification

The `predicate` identifies what data you want Chainhook to scan for using the `scope` define within the `if_this` specification.  Additional arguments specific to the `scope` will also be passed here.

```json
  // [!code word:if_this]
  // [!code word:scope]
  {
    "if_this": {
      "scope": "contract_call",
      "contract_identifier": "STJ81C2WPQHFB6XTG518JKPABWM639R2X37VFKJV.simple-vote-v0",
      "method": "cast-vote"
    }
  }
```

## then_that specification

Chainhook delivers the payload when it is triggered by your `predicate` using the `then_that` specification. There are 2 options available:

1. `file_append`
2. `http_post`

When choosing to use file_append, specify the path where Chainhook will post the payload data.

```json 
// [!code word:then_that]
// [!code word:file_append]
{
  "then_that": {
    "file_append": { 
      "path": "/tmp/events.json"
    }
  }
}
```

When using `http_post`, specify the endpoint's `url` and `authorization_header`.

```json
// [!code word:then_that]
// [!code word:http_post]
{
  "then_that": {
    "http_post": {
      "url": "https://webhook.site/abc123456-789e-0fgh-1ijk-23lmno456789",
      "authorization_header": "12345"
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout title="Note">
  Chainhook requires `https` to post to your endpoint. You can use a service like [LocalTunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) to test locally or a site like [WebhookSite](https://webhook.site).
