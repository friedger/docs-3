title: Predicate design
description: Predicates are the building blocks of Chainhook.
toc: true
---

The core design of Chainhook revolves around the concept of predicates. Each individual Chainhook has a customizable predicate that specifies what the Bitcoin or Stacks blockchain data you are scanning for.

The `predicate` is a JSON object that is composed of elements that allows you to:
- Identify the predicate in the payload Chainhook returns
- Determine the blockchain and network Chainhook will evaluate the predicate against
- Define the scope Chainhook uses to observe transactions and their data
- Deliver the Chainhook payload to specfied end point or file destination
- Setup Stacks and Bitcoin specific configurations for the Chainhook payload

## Predicate JSON object

```json
  {
    // Chain configuration
    "chain": "stacks",
    // Idenfication
    "uuid": "1",
    "name": "STX_Transfer_Predicate",
    "version": 1.0,
    // Network definition
    "networks": {
      "testnet": {
        // if_this specification       
        "if_this": {
          "scope": "stx_transfer",
          "actions": ["transfer"]
        },
        // then_that specification
        "then_that": {
          "file_append": {
            "path": "/tmp/events.json"
          }
        },
      // Additional blockchain specific configurations
        "start_block": 21443,
        "decode_clarity_values": true,
        "expire_after_occurrence": 1,
      }
    }
  }
  ```

<Callout type="info" title="Note">

With Chainhook [installed](/stacks/chainhook/installation), the following commands allow you to generate a predicate template for the specified blockchain.

```
chainhook predicates new your-bitcoin-predicate.json --bitcoin
```
```
chainhook predicates new your-stacks-predicate.json --stacks
```
