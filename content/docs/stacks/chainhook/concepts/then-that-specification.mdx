## The then_that specification

The `then-that` predicate design can use the following attributes to output the result based on the `if-this` condition defined.

```jsonc
// [!code word:file_append]
{
  "then_that": {
    "file_append": {
      "path": "/tmp/events.json",
    },
  },
}
```

```jsonc
// [!code word:http_post]
{
  "then_that": {
    "http_post": {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/v1/events",
      "authorization_header": "Bearer 1234567890"
    }
  }
}
```
