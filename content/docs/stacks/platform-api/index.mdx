The Platform API unlocks powerful automation opportunities in your application code, development and CI scripts, and more, via a familiar REST interface.

In particular, this API lets you programmatically create, update, query, and delete chainhooks as well as interact with a platform-hosted devnet from your local machine.

In order to use these endpoints, you first need to [create an API key](/stacks/api-keys) in the Hiro Platform.
