In this quickstart guide, you will learn how to set up your project, authenticate users with a web wallet, and initiate a STX token transfer.

For a deeper dive into the authentication process, check out the [authenticate users](/stacks/connect/guides/authenticate-users) guide.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Install package dependencies
  
    Add the necessary packages to your project using your preferred package manager.

    ```package-install title="Terminal"
    @stacks/connect @stacks/transactions @stacks/network
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Create an AppConfig and UserSession
  
    Add a reusable `UserSession` instance to your project. This will allow your app to store authentication state in `localStorage`.

    ```ts session.ts
    import { AppConfig, UserSession } from '@stacks/connect';

    const appConfig = new AppConfig(['store_write', 'publish_data']);
    export const userSession = new UserSession({ appConfig });
    ```

    You can now import the `userSession` instance in the following step to continue with the authentication process.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Interacting with the user's wallet
  
    The process of connecting to a wallet gives the web app information about the wallet account, which enables interactions with the Stacks blockchain, like calling smart contracts.

    Using the `showConnect` function, you can prompt the user to select a wallet to connect to your app.

     ```tsx connect.ts
    import { showConnect } from '@stacks/connect';
    import { userSession } from './session';

    const appDetails = {
      name: "My app",
      icon: "logo.png",
    }

    showConnect({
      appDetails,
      userSession,
      onFinish: () => {
        window.location.reload();
      },
      onCancel: () => {
        console.log('oops');
      },
    });
    ```

    This will configure the `showConnect` function to display a wallet connection pop-up with your app's name and icon, and handle user confirmation or cancellation actions in the `onFinish` and `onCancel` callbacks.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Initiate a STX transfer
  
    With a connected wallet, you can now initiate a STX transfer to another account.

    To prompt the user for a STX transfer call, use the `openSTXTransfer` function.

    ```tsx transfer.ts
    import { openSTXTransfer } from '@stacks/connect';
    import { StacksTestnet } from '@stacks/network';
    import { userSession } from './session';

    openSTXTransfer({
      network: new StacksTestnet(),
      recipient: 'ST39MJ145BR6S8C315AG2BD61SJ16E208P1FDK3AK',
      amount: 10000000,
      onFinish: response => {
        console.log(response.txid);
      },
      onCancel: () => {
        console.log('User cancelled');
      },
    });
    ```

    This will prompt the user to confirm and sign a transaction, sending 10 STX to the `recipient` address.

    <Callout>
      The `amount` field is denominated in `microSTX`, which is the smallest fraction of STX. 1,000,000 microSTX = 1 STX.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>
