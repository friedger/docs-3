Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on the `mainnet` network.

You can code with <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>Clarity syntax support</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Using the [Clarity VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HiroSystems.clarity-lsp#:~:text=This%20VS%20Code%20extension%20brings,safety%20checks%2C%20debugger%20and%20more)</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>, run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code. Clarinet can also be used as a hosted service in the cloud via the [Hiro Platform](/stacks/platform).

To get started, check out our [installation guide](/stacks/clarinet/installation).
