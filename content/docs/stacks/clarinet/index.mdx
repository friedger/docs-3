Using a simple command line interface, Clarinet enables you to build and iterate on your contracts locally before moving into production on the `mainnet` network.

You can code with <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>Clarity syntax support</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Using the [Clarity VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HiroSystems.clarity-lsp#:~:text=This%20VS%20Code%20extension%20brings,safety%20checks%2C%20debugger%20and%20more)</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider>, run tests, debug your code line by line, and deploy your contracts to a local Stacks blockchain environment to rapidly iterate on your code. Clarinet can also be used as a hosted service in the cloud via the [Hiro Platform](/stacks/platform).

    ```

    <Callout title="For macOS" type="warn">
      You may receive security errors when running the pre-compiled binary. To resolve the security warning, use the command below and replace the path `/usr/local/bin/clarinet` with your local binary file.

      ```terminal
      $ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /usr/local/bin/clarinet

    <h3 className='scroll-m-20'>Build Clarinet</h3>

    Once you have installed Clarinet using Cargo, you can build Clarinet from the source using Cargo with the following commands:

    ```terminal
    $ git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet.git --recursive
    $ cd clarinet
    $ cargo clarinet-install
    ```

    By default, you will be placed in our development branch, `develop`, with code that has not yet been released.

    - If you plan to submit any code changes, this is the right branch for you.
    - If you prefer the latest stable version, switch to the main branch by entering the command below.

    ```terminal
    $ git checkout main
    ```

    If you have previously checked out the source, ensure you have the latest code (including submodules) before building using this command:

    ```terminal
    $ git checkout main
    $ git pull
    $ git submodule update --recursive
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set up shell completions

Clarinet already has many different commands built in. Therefore, enabling tab completion in your shell may be useful. Using the command below, you can use `clarinet` to generate the shell completion scripts for many common shells.

```terminal
$ clarinet completions (bash|elvish|fish|powershell|zsh)
```

After generating the file, you can refer to the documentation for your shell to determine where this file should be moved to and what other steps may be necessary to enable tab completion for `clarinet`.
