## Under the hood

This command spins up several containers for various services such as a Stacks and Bitcoin node, the Stacks API, and more.

These containers work together to provide all the necessary services for running a local development environment, allowing you to test and interact with your smart contracts locally.

<Callout title="Common errors" type="warn">
  <p>If you are getting `error: clarinet was unable to create network`, make sure you have a container service running locally.</p>
