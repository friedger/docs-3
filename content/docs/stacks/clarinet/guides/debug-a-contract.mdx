import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';
import { Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

import {

  TooltipTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/tooltip"

To debug a contract, let's take the simple `counter` contract from the [Clarinet quickstart](/stacks/clarinet/quickstart) as an example.

```clarity
(define-map Counters principal uint)

(define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
  (default-to u0 (map-get? Counters who))
)

(define-public (count-up)
  (ok (map-set Counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
)
```

To initiate a debug session for this contract, first run the `clarinet console` command inside your project.

```bash title="Terminal"
clarinet console
```

### Trace

The `::trace` command expects an expression, so make a `contract-call?` with our `count-up` function and see what happens.

```bash title="Terminal"
::trace (contract-call? .counter count-up)
```

We should see a complete trace of our `get-count` function call, outputting the arguments that were passed in (`tx-sender`) and return value (`u0`).

Here's an example response from the `::trace` command:
```bash
(contract-call? .counter count-up)  <console>
├── ( get-count tx-sender )  counter:8:38
│   │ ↳ args: ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
│   └ u0
└ (ok true)
```

If we were to run this command again, we should see the return value go from `u0` to `u1`.

### Breakpoints

You also might want to **set a breakpoint** at a specific line to better understand what's happening in your contract.

With `::debug`, you can add **breakpoints** at a specific line of a contract or function to better understand what's happening in your contracts.

To illustrate the power of breakpoints, first add a couple new functions to your contract:

```clarity
;; Existing contract code...

(define-public (count-twice)
  (double)
)

(define-private (double)
  (begin
    (unwrap-panic (count-up))
    (count-up)
  )
)
```

Now add a <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>break</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>To add a breakpoint, use the `break` or `b` command.</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider> on the `count-up` function when calling the new `double` function.

```bash title="Terminal"
::debug (contract-call? .counter count-twice)
break count-up
```

<Callout title="Breakpoint Commands">
To step through these breakpoints, you can use one of the following commands:

- **Step-in (`step` or `s`)**: Step into the sub-expressions.
- **Step-out (`finish` or `f`)**: Complete execution of the current expression and return the result to the parent.
- **Step-over (`next` or `n`)**: Continue to completion of the current expression, stepping over sub-expressions.
- **Continue (`continue` or `c`)**: Continue execution until hitting a breakpoint or completing execution.
</Callout>

Using the `continue` command, the breakpoint you set in the `double` function will trigger twice due to two `count-up` calls, which enables you to do variable and map analysis.
