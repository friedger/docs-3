description: Clarinet provides syntax and semantics checkers for the smart contract language Clarity.

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';
import { Step } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

  TooltipProvider,
  TooltipTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/tooltip"

To verify your contracts, run the `clarinet check` command inside your project.

 ```bash title="Terminal"
clarinet check
```

**Clarinet** uses the `Clarinet.toml` file to locate and analyze all the contracts in the project. If the Clarity code is valid, the command will indicate success with the response below.

```bash title="Terminal"
âœ” 2 contracts checked
```

<Callout title="Warnings" type="info">
The `clarinet check` command may also report warnings indicating the code is valid.
</Callout>

If you want to check the syntax of just a single file in your project, you can use the command below.

```bash title="Terminal"
clarinet check <path/to/file.clar>
```

With this command, `Clarinet` will report syntactical errors, but it does not perform type-checking or other semantic checks as that would require the <TooltipProvider inline><Tooltip><TooltipTrigger asChild><span className='cursor-default border-b border-dotted border-primary'>full context</span></TooltipTrigger><TooltipContent>Because it only looks at this one contract, Clarinet would need the full context to perform a complete check.</TooltipContent></Tooltip></TooltipProvider> for a comprehensive analysis.
