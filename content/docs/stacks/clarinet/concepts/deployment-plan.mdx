title: Deployment plans
description: Deployment plans are reproducible deployment steps that publish a collection of on-chain transactions and one or more contracts to a network.
---

The default deployment plan of every Clarinet project is contained within specifications set inside certain files. In addition to this default deployment plan, the user can manually configure each plan, adding additional transactions or contract calls across multiple Stacks or Bitcoin blocks.

You can commit, audit, and test contracts without including any secrets in the deployment plan, and you can share these contracts without exposing any sensitive information.

## Deployment plan primitives

| Transaction primitive   | Typical usage                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Publish contracts       | Deploy contracts to an in-memory simulated Stacks chain, public networks like testnet and mainnet, or deploy external contracts to your local network for testing purposes. |
| Call contract functions | Call a contract deployed to any of your local devnets or public networks.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Send BTC                | Perform a simple bitcoin transfer from a p2pkh address to a p2pkh address.                                                                                                                       |
| Wait for block          | Test or automate contract deployment across multiple Stacks or Bitcoin blocks.                                                                                                                                             |
| Send STX                | Send stacks to an address or contract.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
