In this quickstart guide, you will write a simple counter contract with Clarity. Throughout this tutorial, you'll learn how to generate a new project, create a smart contract, and validate your smart contract code using the Clarinet CLI.

Check out the [create a new project](/stacks/clarinet/guides/create-a-new-project) and [validate a contract](/stacks/clarinet/guides/validate-a-contract) guides for a deeper look.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ## Generate your counter project
  
    Start by creating a new Clarinet project. This command will create a new directory named `counter` and set up a basic Clarinet project inside it.

    ```console title="Terminal"
    // [!code word:clarinet new]
    clarinet new counter
    ```

    Navigate to the newly created directory:

    ```console title="Terminal"
    cd counter
    ```

    You should see the following files and folders:

    <Files className='pointer-events-none'>
      <Folder name="contracts" />
      <Folder name="settings" defaultOpen>
        <File name="Devnet.toml" />
        <File name="Mainnet.toml" />
        <File name="Testnet.toml" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="tests" />
      <File name=".gitignore" />
      <File name="Clarinet.toml" />
      <File name="package.json" />
      <File name="tsconfig.json" />
      <File name="vitest.config.js" />
    </Files>

    <Callout title="Note">
      The `--stacks` flag is required and allows you to specify the network to scan. Other options include `--bitcoin`.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Create a counter contract
  
    Inside your project, create your first contract. This command will create an empty `counter.clar` file in the **contracts** folder as well as a `counter.test.ts` file in the `tests` folder.

    ```console title="Terminal"
    // [!code word:clarinet contract new]
    clarinet contract new counter
    ```

    <Files className='pointer-events-none'>
      <Folder name="contracts" defaultOpen>
        <File name="counter.clar" className='bg-[hsl(var(--highlight))]' />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="settings" />
      <Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
        <File name="counter.test.ts" className='bg-[hsl(var(--highlight))]' />
      </Folder>
      <File name=".gitignore" />
      <File name="Clarinet.toml" />
      <File name="package.json" />
      <File name="tsconfig.json" />
      <File name="vitest.config.js" />
    </Files>

    It also updates the `Clarinet.toml` file inside your project with the necessary settings.

    ```toml title="Clarinet.toml"
    // [!code word:contracts.counter]
    [contracts.counter]
    path = 'contracts/counter.clar'
    clarity_version = 2
    epoch = 2.5
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Variables and functions
  
    In Clarity, you can define variables and functions to store and manipulate data. Inside your `contracts/counter.clar` file:

    1. Define a map called `Counters` to store the count associated with each user.
    2. Define a public function called `count-up` that increments the count of the user who calls it.
    3. Add a read-only function called `get-count` that returns the count of the user who calls it.

    ```clarity title="counter.clar"
    (define-map Counters principal uint)

    (define-public (count-up)
      (ok (map-set Counters tx-sender (+ (get-count tx-sender) u1)))
    )

    (define-read-only (get-count (who principal))
      (default-to u0 (map-get? Counters who))
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ## Validate your contract
  
    Now it's time to validate your contract. This command will check your contract for errors and typos.

    ```console title="Terminal"
    // [!code word:check]
    clarinet check
    ```

    Once your contract is validated, you can interact with it in a local REPL with the following steps:

    1. Run `clarinet console` from the terminal inside of your project.
    ```console title="Terminal"
    // [!code word:console]
    clarinet console
    ```
    2. Call your contract by running `(contract-call? .counter count-up)`.
    ```clarity
    (contract-call? .counter count-up)
    ```
    3. Verify the count of the user has been incremented by calling the `get-count` function with the `tx-sender` as the argument.
    ```clarity
    (contract-call? .counter get-count tx-sender)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
