Ordhook is a reorg-aware indexer that automatically handles chain forks, so you donâ€™t need to waste time or resources reindexing your database yourself.

With a familiar event-driven framework, you can customize what ordinals data you index in order to create lightweight databases for faster query responses and a better user experience.
