# Build a STX post-condition

A helper function that creates a post-condition for STX token transfers using the `Pc` builder class, ensuring exact amounts are transferred as expected.

## Use cases

- Securing STX token transfers with transfer amount validation

## Example usage

```typescript -cn
import {
  AnchorMode,
  broadcastTransaction,
  makeSTXTokenTransfer,
  Pc,
  PostConditionMode,
} from "@stacks/transactions";

// !hover post-conditions
const pc = Pc.principal("ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM")
  // !hover post-conditions
  .willSendEq(10000000)
  // !hover post-conditions
  .ustx();

const txOptions = {
  recipient: "ST1SJ3DTE5DN7X54YDH5D64R3BCB6A2AG2ZQ8YPD5",
  amount: 10000000,
  senderKey: "753b7cc01a1a2e86221266a154af739463fce51219d97e4f856cd7200c3bd2a601",
  network: STACKS_TESTNET,
  // !hover post-conditions
  postConditions: [pc],
  postConditionMode: PostConditionMode.Deny,
  anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
};

const transaction = await makeSTXTokenTransfer(txOptions);
const broadcastResponse = await broadcastTransaction({
  transaction,
});
```

This example passes in our <HoverLink href="hover:post-condition" className="text-[var(--ch-11)]">post-conditions</HoverLink> as part of the transaction options, ensuring that exactly 10 STX will be transferred from the `ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM` principal.
