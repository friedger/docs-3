# Build an unsigned transaction

A script that constructs an unsigned STX token transfer transaction using Stacks.js, allowing for transaction preparation without immediate signing. This pattern is particularly useful for multi-party transactions where signatures need to be collected separately.

## Use cases

- Implementing offline signing workflows
- Creating sponsored transactions to be signed by a third party
- Setting up transaction proposals for DAO governance

## Signing the transaction

After building your transaction, you can <HoverLink href="hover:sign">sign</HoverLink> and then <HoverLink href="hover:broadcast">broadcast</HoverLink> the newly signed transaction to the network.

```typescript -c
import {
  broadcastTransaction,
  TransactionSigner,
} from "@stacks/transactions";

const privateKey = "<your-private-key>"; // KEEP THIS SECRET!

// !hover sign
const signer = new TransactionSigner(privateKey);
// !hover sign
const signedTx = await signer.signTransaction(transaction);

// !hover broadcast
const broadcastedTx = await broadcastTransaction(signedTx);
```
