# Integrate your API keys using Stacks.js

A script that integrates your API key authentication into Stacks.js network calls using <HoverLink href="hover:middleware">middleware</HoverLink>, allowing for authenticated requests to Stacks APIs that require rate limiting or premium access.

This example is showing a simple STX transfer transaction, but the same approach can be used for any Stacks API request that requires authentication - so long as you are passing in your _typescript`customFetchFn`_ to the client within your transaction details.

## Use cases

- Accessing premium API endpoints with higher rate limits
- Building production applications that require reliable API access

## Example usage

```typescript -nc
import { AnchorMode } from "@stacks/transactions";

const txOptions = {
  network: "testnet",
  recipient: "<recipient-address>",
  amount: 12345n,
  senderKey: "<your-private-key>", // KEEP THIS SECRET!
  memo: "some memo", // optional
  anchorMode: AnchorMode.Any,
  // !mark(1:3)
  client: {
    fetch: customFetchFn,
  },
};
```
