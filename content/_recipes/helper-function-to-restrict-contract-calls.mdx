# Create a helper function to restrict contract calls

A pattern that uses <HoverLink href="hover:principal-destruct?" className="text-[var(--ch-7)]">principal-destruct?</HoverLink> to verify the _clarity`contract-caller`_ is a standard principal (user address) rather than a contract principal (contract address), ensuring transactions remain visible in explorers and APIs.

When contracts call other contracts, these transactions can be harder to track and monitor through standard blockchain explorers and APIs. By enforcing direct user calls, you ensure all interactions are easily auditable and visible in the blockchain's history.

This becomes especially important in scenarios involving treasury operations, voting mechanisms, or other critical protocol operations.

## Use cases

- Preventing "_hidden_" transactions in governance functions
- Protecting sensitive functions from potential contract-based exploits

## Example usage

```clarity -n
(define-public (important-function)
  (begin
    ;; !mark[/(is-standard-principal-call)/]
   (asserts! (is-standard-principal-call) (err u403))
   (ok true)
  )
)
```
