# Deploy a contract

A script that deploys a Clarity smart contract to the Stacks blockchain using Stacks.js.

## Example usage

```typescript
import { STACKS_TESTNET } from "@stacks/network";
import { makeContractDeploy, broadcastTransaction } from "@stacks/transactions";
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';

const txOptions = {
  contractName: "super-cool-contract",
  codeBody: readFileSync("./contract.clar", "utf8"),
  senderKey: "<your-private-key>",
  network: STACKS_TESTNET,
};

const transaction = await makeContractDeploy(txOptions);
const broadcastResponse = await broadcastTransaction({transaction});
const txId = broadcastResponse.txid;
```

This example reads the contract code from a file and uses it to deploy a contract to the Stacks blockchain.
